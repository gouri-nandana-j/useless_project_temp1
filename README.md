### Project Description
The Useless Tab Locker is a malevolent Chrome extension that seizes control of all your browser tabs. It forces you to complete a variety of pointless, and alarming tasks before you can regain access to your precious content.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This project addresses the common behavior of keeping many browser tabs open at once. Our premise is that managing an excessive number of tabs can make it difficult to focus on a single task.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We solve this by forcibly injecting chaos and mandatory pointlessness into the Browse experience. Our extension replaces the illusion of productivity with the harsh, hilarious reality of futility. Instead of letting users see the content they wanted, we block it with a maddening challenge, ensuring maximum frustration.
